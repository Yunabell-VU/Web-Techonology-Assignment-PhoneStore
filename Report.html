        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As for accessibility,  we implement text alternatives for every functionality involved in the webshop index page, which means the page is adaptable for different screens and media, and  a wider range of people with disabilities. Besides, we implement html and CSS properly so that the content and visual layout of web page could be modified respectively and independently, which means the well-constructed web page in html could keep its correct structure while developing adaption details for people with disabilities.</br>
            As for usability, our web page is vivid and client-friendly. We use CSS to implement decorative colors and pictures to distinguish different functional parts of our index page and use Javascript to implement useful interactives.</br>
        </p>

    <section id="Accessibility highlights">
        <h2>Accessibility highlights</h2>
        <p>
            We identify the Guideline 1.3, Adaptable, Guideline 1.4, Distinguishable, and Guideline 2.4, Navigable, to be the most relevant WCAG guidelines to our page.</br>
            Firstly, it is because our page presents elements that are in text format mostly and has just a few non-text content, which means that we are not able to implement Guideline 1.1 about text alternatives to our page significantly although we did it well in alt attributes in img elements, the only part requiring text alternatives. Besides, we did not work much on keyboard accessibility and we just kept its default settings without operating redundant or wrong modifications. And it just worked very well for we could access every functionality we designed for our page. </br>
            Then come the most relevant three guidelines. For 1.3 Adaptable, which includes information, structure, and relationships among elements, as well as meaningful sequence, it is the part that we did a lot of hard-working on. We discussed hours and drafted several versions of web design to determine the content of text information, the structure and proper order of our data and relationships between parts and parts to connect the full page thoroughly as a whole. For 1.4 Distinguishable, we wrote over 700 lines of CSS codes to implement our creativity and imagination as if we were real owners of a webshop, which was commented as too extreme in Assignment 1 and we have improved it in this Assignment 4 with 400+ lines, keeping the vivid and clear visual experience of our page,  instead of the previous 700 lines. For Guideline 2.4 Navigable, we implemented navigation bars leading to different sections of our webshop, picture sliding navigation boxes, in-page jumps that combine various sections together as a integrated real page with totally new inspiring motivations.

                        Readability of the webpage on small devices
                        improved significantly. What we didn't manage to do is the part of &lt;pre&gt; text. We couldn't find a way to change the font size of pre text.
                        It seems Jquery can manage this problem but unfortunately we didn't find the solution.

                        lenght
                        of the stylesheet became 720 lines.
                        Our goal is to shorten the length of the file without losing any styles of the webpage. To
                        achieve
                        this, we classified different contents with same attributes,
                        for example, text with white color, background with orange color and so on. So we can gave them
                        the
                        same class name and don't need to duplicate the style code.
                        Also, we unified the style of two tables, banners, buttons and etc. We successfully compressed the code with 500 lines.
                        For the slides and
                        "services"
                        fancy part, it seems using JavaScript instead of pure css may achieve
                        better performance and less sloppy, however we didn't manage to do that because of lack of time.

            <td>
                We partially comply to guideline 1.1 about text alternatives of non-text content, because our page was
                not complicated enough to apply most of the situations listed in WCAG2.0. </br>
                As for setting alternatives in img elements and using CSS for decorative elements, we succeed to comply
                to the guideline. Alt attributes in img elements allow the page to present a text description of picture
                when the image not loaded successfully. When we design a web page, we must consider as many particular
                situations as possible, network connection is a quite common concern when we think about web page or
                internet transmission, the alt attributes offer us one of solutions for this situation. Using CSS for
                decorative elements also benefits a lot on web design because as technology evolves, a web page should
                be displayed properly on different sizes of screens and other formats of different media with various
                purposes, which requires web designer separate the content and the decoration to realise the functions
                mentioned above. That’s the reason we use CSS for decorative elements.</br>
                However, the rest lines of guideline 1.1 do not apply to our web page because we just designed a concise
                index page of a online phone shop and aspects of controls, time-based media, tests, sensory and CAPTCHA,
                which are realised by Flash, Silverlight, PDF and so on, are not necessary for our page. In addition, we
                just involved few non-text contents in our web page which made us have no needs to use tools listed in
                the guideline to get access to non-text contents. We should keep our codes simple and readable while
                sufficient so we just use methods suitable for us.

                We comply to guideline 1.3 at several aspects, such as using id, table, header, semantic element, text
                formatting, etc. The contents displayed with different colors always accompanied with id attributes or
                semantic elements to indicate its structure or relations with other elements. And we use table and list
                to present contents with meaningful sequences so that they can be fixed in required order for all
                adaption.</br>
                However, guidelines about color distinguishing do not apply to our page, because we did not use color,
                sound or any sensory elements to transfer information. Colors are just decorative elements in our case.

                shop’s index page.</br>
                We successfully comply to guideline 2.4.3 Focus Order. Our page has a form that can be manually input,

                order, the same as the order these information being displayed after submission.</br>

                destination of the link.
